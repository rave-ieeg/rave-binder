#' @title This file is used to demonstrate how rave-snippet works
#' 
#' A RAVE code snippet contains three sections: 
#'   * documentation section, 
#'   * variable section, 
#'   * code section.
#' 
#' This documentation is located at `documentation section`, starting with two 
#' characters `#'`. The section ends with `#' END OF DOC`. The documentation 
#' section describes what the code snippets do, and what are
#' the inputs and outputs, and possibly with examples. To understand what 
#' inputs are, look for keywords `@param`, for example:
#' 
#' @param my_input defines an input argument `my_input`, followed by 
#' its explanation
#' 
#' 
#' The variable section starts right after `#' END OF DOC`. They are usually 
#' commented for a reason (see 'How to use snippets' below). You can download 
#' and un-comment these lines and run snippets as standalone scripts.
#' 
#' The last section is code section, usually you don't have to change the magic
#' there unless you know what you are doing.
#' 
#' @section How to use rave-snippets:
#' 
#' Scenario 1: You can download the script to your local disk, from there
#' un-comment the *variable section*, set variable as required, and run the
#' whole script using `ctrl/command+shift+enter` (or `command+enter` to run 
#' line by line)
#' 
#' Scenario 2: You can use `rave` built-in functions to load the snippet:
#'   
#'     topic <- "dummy-snippet"   # <- this should be the snippet name
#'     snippet <- raveio::load_snippet(topic); snippet
#'     snippet(param1 = ..., param2 = ...)
#'  
#' END OF DOC
NULL

# ---- Variable Section --------------------------------------------------------

# # For standalone scripts only, please un-comment to set your own variables
# # You can select lines, use `Ctrl/Command + Shift + C` to quick un-comment
# my_input <- "some message"

# ---- Code Section ------------------------------------------------------------

# DO NOT EDIT ME UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING

`%?<-%` <- dipsaus::`%?<-%`
my_input %?<-% "There is no input..."
my_input <- paste(my_input, collapse = "")

message(my_input)
